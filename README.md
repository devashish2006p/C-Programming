# C Programming Notes 
This repository contains my personal notes for learning C programming.
It is being updated gradually and currently focuses on C fundamentals.
Advanced and system-level topics will be added later.

# Goal
The goal of this repository is to build a strong foundation in C programming
with clear concepts and practical examples, which will later support
system-level programming and operating system concepts.

# Status
This repository is a work in progress.
Notes are added and refined regularly as learning progresses.
